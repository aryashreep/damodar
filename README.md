# Damodar(Karthik) month celebration with animation

The festival of offering lamps to Lord Krishna, lasts the entire month of Damodara, (Kartika, usually during Oct-Nov), which glorifies Krishna's pastime of being bound with ropes by Mother Yasoda. Observing vrata (austerities) in the month of Kartika is glorified in the Puranas.
